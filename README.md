How to contribute
-----------------

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and there are many ways to do it: 

 * Using the app from the store, and reporting feedback 
 * Download it from github and test all new features
 * Contribute with some code (have a look at the Issues section)
 * Opening inssues

Or if you want to support me you can donate to my patreon (https://www.patreon.com/inuyasha82)

If you want to contribute with code, the easiest way is to user github pull requests:

 * Create a fork of the project from master
 * Make your changes
 * Push  them to your fork
 * Once done create a pull request against master repo (of the original branch, not yours)

If you don't know how to create a Pull Request, here a link with a short tutorial:
